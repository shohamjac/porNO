This is the porNO - a small program to prank your friends with.

You are sending them the .exe file with a message like "hey! look what I made", and when they open it, they see your fun little game (in this version - it is a small window that jumps when you click it). Little did they know that in the meantime, the program registerd itself in the registry, for persistancy, and is monitoring their other window's title. What for? you ask. Well, to fill their screen with error boxes the minute they will try to get into porn!

After that, the program will wait for 9 hours. Longing for their next "session".
